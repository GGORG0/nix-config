# GGORG's Nix(OS) Config

This is my latest and greatest system configuration, written in Nix.
I use home-manager to manage my Hyprland rice and others.

My laptop is my main computer and runs Hyprland.
My tablet, which is used for school (I only use it for viewing textbooks, doing handwritten notes and other on-the-go tasks) runs GNOME.
